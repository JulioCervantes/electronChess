{Want to improve at chess? Then you'll need to improve your understanding of
chess strategy. You probably knew that already - but how to begin to study
such a vast and seemingly complex subject? International Master Adam Hunt is a
full-time chess teacher and is thus very familiar with this problem. His
solution is to present an accessible and easy-to-read guide for club players
and juniors. Hunt studies all the key components of chess strategy, including
development, king safety, attack and defence, initiative, pawn play and much
more. He examines not only grandmaster games but also those played by students,
demonstrates model strategic play, identifies typical mistakes and explains
how to avoid them. --- 'Move by Move' provides an ideal platform to study
chess. By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions
throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning
and practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to improve your chess skills and knowledge.} 1. -- {Adam Hunt
is an International Master from Oxford with two Grandmaster norms. Since 2003
he has taught chess full-time at Woodbridge School in Suffolk, helping the
school along the way to produce three England representatives. He has acquired
a growing reputation for coaching having also worked with the England and
Wales junior teams at many international events, including the World Youth
Championships and World Under-16 Olympiad. He comes from a family of chess
players, with his sister Harriet currently ranked as the top female player in
England. This is his first book.} *

{The 'Move by Move' format is designed to be interactive, and is based on
questions asked by both teachers and students. It aims - as much as possible -
to replicate chess lessons. All the way through, readers will be challenged to
answer searching questions and to complete exercises, to test their skills in
key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like
this is an excellent way to study chess.} 1. -- {Many thanks go to all those
who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice and assistance in the
creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this series and hope that
readers will share our enthusiasm.} (1. -- {John Emms, Everyman Chess}) *

{Welcome to the wonderful world of Chess Strategy! I really hope that you
enjoy the material presented here - it has been the culmination of over a
year's hard work and has been written whilst I have taken a sabbatical from my
job, teaching chess at Woodbridge School. The writing has sat hand-in-hand
with playing chess full-time, as I chased the dream of becoming a Grandmaster 
(which I failed). There have been many personal highs and lows along the way -
usually as a direct result of how the various tournaments were going! ---
Chess strategy is concerned with the correct evaluation of a position and the
formulation of an effective plan based upon its characteristic features. When
the word 'strategy' is mentioned, people tend to jump to the conclusion that
we are talking about long-term middlegame planning, and that you have to be
some sort of psychic who can see the future, but that is rarely the case. Many
features of a given position which are strategically important will evolve out
of the opening and finish in the endgame, so it would be foolish to completely
ignore these phases of the game. Plans can be short or long term, depending on
how the landscape in front of you is changing as the game progresses. This is
why the subject is so complex and so much material is available on it. I have
decided to split the book into twelve chapters; to be honest each one could be
extended into a whole book in itself (in some cases the subjects have!). In
each, I hope to give a flavour of an area of the game which I think is
important. --- I hope that this book is interesting and unique, not
necessarily because all the ideas are revolutionary and ground breaking - they
most certainly are not. Indeed a lot of the ideas I have written about are
taken from previous literature, but I have tried to present them with the
enthusiasm and energy that would go into my day to day teaching. There are
many 'classic' grandmaster games presented in this book, some of which you may
be familiar with and some you may not (but all of which I think you will find
useful to study). There are also a number of examples taken from my own games
and those of my students in which there are mistakes aplenty that we can learn
from. I am hoping this will appeal to the reader of this book and indeed be in
keeping with the general interactive approach to the 'Move by Move' series. I
am also hopeful that this book can be used by teachers as well as students,
and that a dip into it will provide useful coaching material for the next
generation of up-and-coming chess players.} 1. -- {I would like to thank
everyone who has supported me in the writing of this book. The proof-readers,
Caro, Harriet and John for their helpful comments and patient, polite
corrections of my terrible grammar. A big thanks also to Sabrina, for her
assistance and advice throughout the course of the last year, and to Arthur
for being a great coach and source of ideas. Thank you to John Emms for giving
me the opportunity to write for Everyman Chess and Richard Palliser for the
editing. Particular thanks go to my students, who have provided me with
countless pages of material that I think you will find useful and interesting.
Apologies in advance to those whose losses or mistakes I have included. To the
ones whose brilliant wins I have put in, the least you can do is buy a copy of
the book! --- Appreciation of both strategy and tactics are the 'Ying and
Yang' of a strong chess player. They sit side by side, in harmony with each
other and you cannot hope to' improve your play without working on both
aspects of the game. Usually, in order to improve our tactical ability, we
solve exercises and problems from books or electronic media. I hope that with
this work, the questions and exercises I ask you to solve and think about will
help improve your strategic play in a similar way. Let's get started!} (1. -- {

{'What matters is not the breadth of the centre, but its solidity.' - Max Euwe
} 1. -- {The first maxim we are normally taught when learning to play chess is
to control the middle of the board and in particular the central squares e4,
d4, d5 and e5. This is relatively easy for the novice to understand and
implement, from as early as move one with 1 d4 or 1 e4. Being in possession of
a stable centre is recognized as advantageous. Pieces find it easier to move
into attacking and defensive positions from the centre, and the advance of
central pawns will more often than not create disruption in the opponent's
position. In this chapter I will start by discussing the differing historical
views on central control, before moving on to looking at some of the different
types of pawn centre and how to handle them.} *

{A Brief History of the Centre: In the past 150 years or so opinions have
changed on the best way to fight for control of the centre. These differing
schools of thought and the fashions of different openings are one of the many
fascinating developments of chess theory. The 'Classical' viewpoint is to
occupy the centre with pawns from the word go. The first recognized World
Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz (born 1836, World Champion 1886-1894) was one of
the first masters to champion this school of thought. Prior to Steinitz the
age of chess was one of 'Romanticism', where players gave up pawns for fun.
Steinitz took a more sober approach to the opening.} 1. -- {Later great
players such as Siegbert Tarrasch (1862-1934) and the Cuban World Champion
José Raul Capablanca (1888-1942) supported and developed the Classical view.} (
{Openings such as the Ruy Lopez and Queens Gambit Declined, where the central
pawns are quickly stabilized, grew in popularity, whilst flank gambits, such
as the King's Gambit (} 1. e4 e5 2. f4 {)}) ({and the Danish Gambit (} 1. e4 e5
2. d4 exd4 3. c3 {), fell somewhat by the wayside. I would like to present a
powerful game of the time, played by the Hungarian Grandmaster Richard Réti.})
({Although Réti later became famous for his hypermodern thinking and
development of the opening which bears his name (} 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 {), here he
produces an instructive example of straightforward Classical chess.}) *

square whilst putting pressure on the central e5-pawn by attacking its

dark-squared bishop in. --- EXERCISE: What should White play after Stark's 4...d6?} ({These days the Berlin Defence starting with} 4... Nxe4 {has become all

QUESTION: Hang on a minute - hasn't White just given up the bishop-pair and
opened the b-file for Black's rook? --- ANSWER: Well, yes, he has, but the
problem was that Black was preparing to exchange off the knights and
light-squared bishops with 9...Nxd4. White has created an imbalance 
(bishop-pair for Black; better pawn structure and good knight on d4 for White),

the queen was on d1, this idea may have worked.}) 11. Bxe7 Qxe7 {EXERCISE:
What should White play here? --- ANSWER:} 12. f4 $1 {Controlling the important
e5-square.} f5 {Black decides to fight back in the centre.} ({I would have
preferred} 12... Rab8 13. b3 Rfe8 {, though I still think White is a bit
better due to his central control.}) 13. Rae1 fxe4 {QUESTION: Which is the
best way to recapture? --- ANSWER:} 14. Nxe4 $1 {Centralization! This is a
very important principle to remember. The knight is en route to a better home.}
(14. Rxe4 $6 {is a bit too 'obvious'. Rooks are often just as effective on the
first rank and this is a good example of that. After something like} Qf7 15.
Rfe1 d5 16. Re7 Qxf4 {Black's counterplay is in full swing.}) ({Meanwhile, we
don't want to swap the queens off with} 14. Qxe4 Qxe4 15. Rxe4 Rae8 {when
Black is very comfortable.}) 14... Qh4 15. h3 Nf6 {QUESTION: White has
centralized all his pieces. What now? --- ANSWER:} 16. Ng5 $1 {The knight
heads for the fabulous outpost on e6.} ({Instead} 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {would ease
Black's defensive task.}) 16... d5 17. Nge6 Bxe6 ({Trying to exploit the pin
down the e-file with} 17... Rfe8 {would be met with} 18. Nf5 $1 Qh5 19. Nfxg7 {
, forking the queen and rook.}) 18. Rxe6 {Again the 'obvious' recapture is not
necessarily the best. White attacks the c6-pawn and sets a well-concealed trap,
} ({whereas} 18. Nxe6 {allows} Rf7 {.}) 18... c5 $2 {EXERCISE: Black's last
move loses immediately. Can you see how? --- ANSWER:} 19. Nf5 Qh5 20. Rxf6 $1 {
Hopefully you saw this detail before playing 19 Nf5, but it requires some
calculation. And rather unsportingly here Black resigned.} ({If} 20. Rxf6 Rxf6

smooth game by Réti. White established a small but stable central advantage
which made Black's position slightly the more difficult to play. 12...f5
seemed to help White as it gave him an access point for his knight. I also
didn't like 7...exd4 as it conceded the centre too cheaply.}) 1-0

{The Hypermodernists Have Their Say: After World War I (1914-18), a new school
of thought regarding the opening emerged, the 'Hypermodern approach'. This was
led by creative players, such as our friend Richard Réti, Aron Nimzowitsch and
Alexander Alekhine. They argued that conceding the centre, waiting for the
opponent to overextend and then counterattacking to obtain important squares
for the pieces was an effective strategy. Openings such as the Nimzo-Indian,
King's Indian and Grünfeld Defence became popular against 1 d4, and the
Alekhine and Sicilian Dragon against} 1. e4 {. --- The Hypermodern approach
appeals because from the word go an imbalance is created, leading to a more
dynamic and often sharper struggle. From a strategic perspective, however, it
can hardly be called correct due to the space conceded. The hypermodern player
will have to have strong nerves and plenty of energy in order to prevail! ---
It is important as a strong chess player to be able to understand both the
Classical and Hypermodern schools of thought equally well. Here future World
Champion Dr. Max Euwe plays against perhaps the most extreme form of central
control in the opening and shows that it is possible to counter such dominance.

and White certainly should have pushed his central d-pawn when he had the
chance. This game goes to show one of the main drawbacks of a large centre:
the cost in time taken to build it often results in a lead in development for
the opponent. This resulted here in a weakened white king position which
eventually decided the game.} 0-1

school started to take over, culminating in Mikhail Botvinnik, the sixth World
Champion, coming to the chess throne in 1948. The Soviets looked to build upon
both the hypermodern and classical ways of thinking. They tended to favour the
classical approach, whilst stressing the importance of taking the initiative
and using active piece play, often at the cost of central pawn weaknesses. A
good example of this is a variation in the Sicilian Defence named after former
world championship candidate Isaac Boleslavsky (1919-1977).} *

modern era by the great American Bobby Fischer (1943-2008). He played in a
very classical style as White, almost always playing 1 e4 while looking to
develop quickly and directly. As Black his usual choice was to play an
unbalanced, hypermodern Grünfeld or King's Indian Defence against 1 d4, and a
dynamic Sicilian Defence against 1 e4. Being comfortable with all three
different schools, Fischer's chess was the blueprint for many future greats,
including Garry Kasparov. Here we see a 13 year-old (!) Fischer defeating
Grandmaster Robert Byrne in a classic game which was dubbed 'game of century'
by writer and arbiter Hans Kmoch in 'Chess Review'.} *

1. -- {Castling on Opposite Sides of the Board: Some of the sharpest and most
exciting struggles on the chessboard occur when the two players decide to
castle on opposite wings to each other. Here a direct attack on the king is
often the best strategy. A pawnstorm, or use of the pawns as the first wave of
attack, is often required to blow open files and diagonals for the major
pieces. Time can be of the utmost importance and unnecessarily delaying your
attack can have grave consequences. Hooks for the foot soldiers to latch on to
make pawn attacks even more effective. Examine the following game to see
exactly what I mean.} *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {. The Spanish is considered a testing opening for
Black for many reasons, but one of the simplest to understand is that White
develops a piece whilst attacking an enemy unit (in this case applying some
indirect pressure to the central e5-pawn by threatening the defender). The
concept of developing with tempo forms the basis of effective, speedy
development. Don't delay and don't move your pieces twice (or three, or four
times) until everything is developed! --- Falling behind in development in the
opening is a very risky idea. It often happens due to one player moving a
piece more than once, often to grab a pawn or two. Witness the following
massacre as a warning shot (see the following game).} *

{Having a lead in development is all very well and good, but it is just as
important to realize that such an advantage is very much short term, as your
opponent will probably get round to bringing their pieces out eventually! It
is therefore vital that you are able to use this lead in development quickly
when the opportunity arises. Take a look at the following game extract, taken
from John Walker's book 'Attacking the King', where Black uses his development
advantage to maximum effect.} 7... Bb4 8. Nde2 $2 {White tries to stop Black

{'The pawns are the soul of the game.' - Philidor} 1. -- {My trainer during
the course of my year playing chess full-time, GM Arthur Kogan, nicely
describes pawn structures as "the GPS of chess". A quick-fire way if you like
of recognising what you should be looking to do in a given middlegame position.
A successful understanding of common structures will enable you to play both
familiar and, perhaps most importantly, unfamiliar middlegame positions
arising from the opening with confidence. I am reliably informed that the
so-called 'Russian chess school' spend a great deal of time on this part of
the game, whereas in Western Europe, particularly in the training of young
players, it is often overlooked. --- A good fundamental grounding in the
typical pawn structures and ways that we use pawns is invaluable and will
certainly improve your game. I have learnt an awful lot during the course
2011-12 - perhaps more on this than on any other subject, simply because I
didn't appreciate how important these little guys are!} *

{One thing we are all taught at a young age (hopefully!) is that advancing
your pawns gives you more space. This is quite rightly seen as a good thing,
as it gives the pieces more freedom to move behind them. Take the following
simple opening position after} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d6 3. c4 c6 4. f4 f6 {. White
enjoys a clear space advantage and this allows him to develop his knights to
their natural squares (c3 and f3), and gives the bishops the options of d3 and
e3. Black, on the other hand, in order to castle will have to develop his
knights to a6 and h6, or via d7-b6 and e7-g6, and thus lose valuable time.
This comes as second nature to the experienced player, but at novice level
building a wall of pawns like this is incredibly tempting and common. --- A
slightly less obvious benefit lies in the ability to later use a space
advantage in one area of the board to force through an attack. This is
particularly true if the pawns cross the fourth rank and enter the opponent's
half of the board.} *

{No pawn exchanges, no file-opening, no attack." - Aron Nimzowitsch} 25. -- {
A pawn break, to put it simply, is the offer to exchange a pair of pawns,
usually in order to open up a file. In my experience of coaching juniors, most
could make more effective organization and use of pawn breaks. As Nimzowitsch
put it, this is the key to a successful attack, particularly in positions of a
closed nature. When you think about it this idea makes a lot of sense. Rooks
and in a lot of cases queens cannot function properly without open files.
Let's first demonstrate exactly what we mean by a pawn break, using an example
taken from one of my own games.} (25. -- {EXERCISE: Identify the pawn breaks
available to both sides in this position. --- ANSWER: This position has come
about from a main line Spanish opening and we can see that only one pair of
pieces (knights) has been exchanged. Both sides have pawn breaks available to
them. White can play a2-a4, b3-b4, f2-f4 and h3-h4-h5. These are all pawn
breaks, discounting for the moment the effectiveness of each one. Black has
fewer breaks: ...a6-a5-a4 (after the queen moves), ...f6-f5 and ...h7-h5.
However, the breaks that he has are more effective as they are easier to carry
out without compromising his position. Indeed, a2-a4 will open the b-file for
the black rook, while the b4-square is very well covered by Black. Similarly,
f2-f4 will give Black a strong outpost on e5 for his knight and advancing the
h-pawn will leave the white g4-pawn and king weaker. As a result Black's
position is much easier to play.}) 1-0

to get to the bottom of, but I don't like the move in this particular position.

which stops the white bishop coming to d3, as well as fixing the weak square
on b3. However, once again Black loses some of the dynamism in his position,

potential outpost on d4 if the knight can reach it.}) 11. Bc2 {QUESTION: Okay,
what now? --- ANSWER: The queenside is closed as there are no pawn breaks
available there, so Black can turn his attention to playing on the kingside.}
f5 {A very interesting decision, which apparently closes the position up. Less
inexperienced players often think that the game is inevitably heading for a
draw in such positions. However, there are still chances to open lines, so
it's actually far too early to say that!} ({The first move that came to my
mind was} 11... g5 {, but there seems to be a problem: White can change the
pawn structure with} 12. exf6 Nxf6 13. Re1 Bd6 14. a4 Rde8 15. Ne5 $1 {with
the age old problem of a knight occupying the outpost! White enjoys a decent
game here thanks to the position of the knight and may follow up with b5 and
Ba3 to exchange off the dark-squared bishop.}) 12. Nh4 $6 {Grischuk wants to
shut down the kingside with f2-f4, but doesn't really achieve his aim, as the ...g7-g5 pawn break is still always possible.} (12. h4 {would be another way of
trying to keep the kingside closed. Then:} Be8 $1 {would be a typical
manoeuvre, bringing the bishop to h5 and allowing the queen to join in the
game.} (12... g5 $5 {is the most energetic move and I also like this
suggestion. Perhaps the only problem is that after} 13. hxg5 Be8 {White can
close the h-file with} 14. g6 {. Having said that, after} Bxg6 15. Bf4 Bh5 {I
still like Black's position.})) 12... Be8 13. f4 Be7 14. Nxf5 $6 {Incredible!
White must have felt so uncomfortable about the threat of ...g7-g5 that he
decides to sacrifice a piece. A famous saying in chess is that "the threat is
stronger than the execution", which is usually attributed to Aron Nimzowitsch 
(though the chess historian Edward Winter thinks that the quote could be
earlier than this, from the late 19th century). One of the points is that the
psychological pressure of the threat can cause the opponent to make an
unexpected and in this case sub-optimal reply.} ({After the more natural} 14.

Summary: A very well-played game from Nigel Short. By retaining the tension
for as long as possible after his ...c5 and ...f6 breaks, Black was able to
shift his king to the queenside before starting his attack. 12...f5 was well
timed and, as is often the case, when White couldn't see a comfortable way to

1. -- {The Isolated Pawn: Okay, let's start with the basics. An isolated pawn
by definition is a pawn that has no friendly pawn on an adjacent file. An
isolated queen's (d-) pawn is often called an isolani. Isolated pawns are
usually a weakness because they cannot be protected by other pawns. Whole
books have been written on the subject of the isolated pawn. In fact, whole
books have been written specifically on the subject of the isolated queen's
pawn, such as Winning Pawn Structures by Alexander Baburin. I cannot begin to
discuss the isolated pawn in as much depth as such a book, but I hope to give
you a flavour of the interesting positions that can arise. --- The reason that
an isolani is so common is that although the isolated pawn is generally
recognized as a weakness, many openings are designed to allow this structure,
for certain other benefits, such as a lead in development, a space advantage
or control of a crucial square. Throughout my chess career I have always
played the Panov-Botvinnik Attack against the Caro-Kann, which often leads to
IQP (Isolated Queen's Pawn) positions and many other openings lead to the same
structure, including variations of the Slav and Queen's Gambit, the French and
the Tarrasch Defence.} *

{Let's start with a classic example of how to play against an isolated pawn
and see if we can play like former World Champion Anatoly Karpov!} 1. c4 e6 2.
Nc3 d5 3. d4 Be7 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 O-O 7. Rc1 dxc4 8. e3 c5 9. Bxc4
cxd4 {EXERCISE: This is where White faces his first major decision. Which way
should he recapture? --- ANSWER:} 10. exd4 {White decides to give himself an
isolani. When there are so many pieces still on the board, this weakness is
rarely felt. It is only when the endgame approaches that this pawn may fall.
--- QUESTION: In exchange for the isolated pawn what positional advantages
does White obtain? --- ANSWER: Threefold: 1) Most importantly White enjoys a
slight space advantage. The d4-pawn cramps Black's position by hindering the ...e6-e5 advance. Consequently the power of the c8-bishop is reduced and this
piece will be hard to develop. Black will often have to play ...b6 and ...Bb7,
which can use up valuable time, as well as set up some tactical ideas for
White based on the weak h1-a8 diagonal and the loose knight on c6. --- 2) The
d-pawn gives White some control over c5 and more importantly e5, which is a
valuable central square in the black camp that could be used by a knight in
the future. We will see how useful this can be in the game Hunt-Danielian
later on. --- 3) Finally, the d4-pawn can often be advanced to d5, bringing
the white pieces to life and opening up the central file towards the black
queen.} (10. Nxd4 {would have also been perfectly reasonable, but would have
given Black the freeing ...e5 break whenever he wished. In fact these days
this move is seen more often, perhaps as a result of this game?}) 10... Nc6 11.

see how White should respond? --- ANSWER:} 13. d5 $1 {- if you got this move,
then well done as we haven't discussed this typical central thrust yet, but it

A highly instructive tussle between two greats of the game. It isn't easy to
put your finger on exactly where Korchnoi went wrong, but Karpov managed to
effectively prevent the d4-pawn from becoming too big an obstacle to the

and strong. White plans to build up pressure on the d5-pawn, again tying Black
down to the defence of his isolated pawn.} (16. Rac1 {(the computer's first

as he can without engaging the enemy. How would you continue now? --- ANSWER:}

defend the square in front of it. Access to this square will allow Botvinnik
to set up a kingside attack.} (19. Nd4 {would also have been good, but was not

Calculate the consequences of the thematic breakthrough 25 e4.} 25. g4 {Having
presumably seen that 25 e4 didn't promise enough, Botvinnik uses the hook on
h6 to lever open the g-file. Of course, such a move should not be made lightly
as it weakens both White's pawn structure and also his king. However, without
any active pieces other that the queen on c5 Black's counterplay is limited.
White attempts to open a 'second front' on the kingside to create further
weaknesses, while Black's rooks and bishop are passively placed and therefore
will find it difficult to switch their sphere of operations.} ({ANSWER: We saw

Botvinnik's style. White built up slowly against the isolated pawn, tying the
black forces down to its defence, before switching the direction of the attack
to the kingside where Black was unable to cope with the opening of a second
front. Note the way that 19 Ne5 gave White important access to and control of
the square in front of the isolani.} 1-0

looks like a good move, immediately hitting the weak pawn. I was surprised by
Arthur Kogan's reaction to it though, which I felt was instructive. White's
problem here (apart from his shattered kingside pawn structure) is obviously
the weak pawn on c3. However, the presence of the bishop-pair as well as the
open b-file provides certain compensation for this. The idea of preventing the
c-pawn from advancing and occupying the square in front of it never even
occurred to me during the game. Perhaps I should have studied more of

1. -- {The Backward Pawn: We now move on to a discussion of the 'backward'
pawn, which is a pawn behind friendly pawns on adjacent files and one that
cannot move without being lost. Backward pawns are particularly vulnerable if
they are on semi-open files, as the opposing major pieces can build up
pressure and tie the owner of the backward pawn down to defending it, in a
similar way to what we have seen with isolated pawns. The similarities
continue as there is often a hole in front of a backward pawn that can be
occupied by an enemy piece. We shall start by taking a look at a strategic
masterpiece by Polish Grandmaster Akiba Rubinstein against his one-time
training partner Georg Salwe.} *

Rubinstein played a good strategic game against the backward c-pawn, firstly
by immobilizing it, then by gradually exchanging off minor pieces, leaving the
black rooks and queen tied down to its defence. He then used the typical motif
of advancing a pawn to exploit the pin down the c-file and exert further
pressure. This provoked Black into creating another weakness (in this case the
a-pawn), before eventually White picked the c-pawn off.} 1-0

strategic move in itself and yet one that crops up in many types of Open
Sicilian! The reader I am sure will have at least seen this position before,
as it was the weapon of arguably the two most famous World Champions of them
all, Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer. Black voluntarily gives himself a
backward d-pawn on a semi-open file and permanently weakens the d5-square. In
exchange for this he removes the white knight from its strong square on d4 and
allows his light-squared bishop (in most cases) to take up an active residence
on e6. Is that really enough for the long-term weakness he has given himself?
Current theory thinks it probably is, though White obviously has a wide
variety of ways to play. What is certain is that it is of the utmost
importance that the second player continues dynamically or he will find
himself in serious trouble. Here we examine a game played by two of the

of how to play against the so called 'hanging pawn' formation: two pawns side

{1) The pawn structure will often determine the side of the board that you
should be playing on. Be thinking about whether you are further advanced on
the kingside or queenside and let your pawns guide you!} 1. -- {2) Pawn breaks
make the middlegame much easier to handle as they allow your major pieces into
the action. An early break in the opening is often useful in this respect. As
a caveat be careful about making pawn breaks on the side of the board where
you are weakest.} (1. -- {3) Weak pawns, such as doubled or isolated pawns,
can have their dynamic advantages in the middlegame. Doubled pawns give you
open files and isolated pawns can act as a springboard for the pieces to reach
important central squares. However, the further in the game we go, the more
difficult it will be to defend such pawns.}) (1. -- {4) Hanging pawns are
normally dead ducks unless they manage to become mobile. Look to restrict
their potential advance and pick them off later in the game.}) *

{'It is annoying that the rules of chess do not allow a pawn to take either
horizontally or backwards, but only forwards... This psychological tuning is
ideal for attacking purposes, but what about for defence?' - David Bronstein} 
1. -- {One mistake that seems to crop up a lot at amateur level is the failure
to recognize the weakness of individual squares or a complex of squares (a
number of squares of the same colour that are linked). I find this is
particularly true at junior level, where children are playing to give mate
most of the time! Seizing control of an important square can be as important
as other advantages we have already discussed, such as a lead in development
or a space advantage. --- What is a weak square? We can define a weak square
as one that cannot be defended by a pawn and as a result of this is a great
place for a higher-valued piece belonging to the enemy to occupy. Outpost
squares are particularly weak squares. Nimzowitsch, in 'My System', defines an
outpost as: "by an outpost we mean one of our own pieces (normally a knight),
which is placed, being protected (by a pawn) and on an open file within enemy
territory." --- The bit about being in enemy territory is particularly
important, as a knight's influence grows significantly the further up the
board it is. I would also add that I usually refer to an outpost only if the
piece or square cannot be attacked by an enemy pawn. Personally I don't think
it matters too much as to the exact definition of the term, but what is
important is that an outpost square is quickly recognized as a great one for
our pieces!} *

are particularly useful in outposts as we have just seen. The reason for this
is that they need advanced support points in order to be effective due to
their relatively short range of movement, when compared to, say, a bishop or
rook which can influence operations from further away. It is the dream of a
knight to find a central outpost (on the c-, d- ,e- or f-files) in enemy
territory on the fifth, or even better the sixth rank.} 1-0

Actually dug by little pawns, Mercury Rev. We can think of outposts as extreme
forms of holes. If we are trying to define the terms we can say that a hole
and an outpost differ in that an outpost is controlled by a pawn, whereas a
hole is simply a square that cannot be defended by the enemy's pawns. As a
small exercise examine the position below.} (18. -- {EXERCISE: Name all the

the French Winawer. In this position a simple count tells us that five of the
six black pawns are on light squares. Therefore Black is vulnerable on the
dark squares as the pawns are not controlling them. This is made worse by the
fact there is no dark-squared bishop present to control the dark squares and

successful in defending his weak dark-square colour complex by blockading the

{1) The advance of too many pawns in the opening can create holes and,
sometimes more significantly, outposts which enemy pieces can exploit. If you
see such a square a successful strategy will often be to destroy any potential
defenders before occupying it.} 1. -- {2) Remember pieces, not pawns, in
outposts. Knights love them, especially if they are on the fifth and sixth
ranks.} (1. -- {3) Fianchettos weaken the kingside (or queenside) pawn
structure and create potential holes. Look to exchange off the fianchettoed
bishop for maximum effect.}) (1. -- {4) Squares are linked to each other
diagonally by colour, creating complexes which bishops and queens can look to
exploit. Be very wary about creating pawn chains for this reason, placing all
your pawns on squares of the same colour. However, if your opponent only has
one bishop remaining, you can look to target that piece by restricting its
movement using a chain.}) *

{If you are stuck for a plan, improve your worst-placed piece.} 1. -- {This
famous piece of chess advice is very useful to remember. Its origins are still
unclear, but popular opinion seems to be that they are the words of
Grandmaster Vladimir Makogonov (1904-1993), who was one of Garry Kasparov's
first chess trainers. It is of particular importance in positions where there
are no obvious targets or weaknesses to aim at in your opponent's camp.
Notably this simple idea can be substituted for middle or long-term planning.
It is very rarely a bad idea to improve a piece that is not working at full
power. To see an example, let's take a look at a game of two-time Soviet
champion Vitaly Tseshkovsky.} *

{This recent game made a nice impression on me and was made all the more
impressive due to the fact that it was a rapidplay game. Let's put ourselves
in Carlsen's shoes. --- EXERCISE: White has just played} 39. Nb4 {. What is
the worst piece here for Black and how do we go about improving its position?}
Bd8 $1 (39... Ra5 {would also have been very sensible, to reroute the rook via
the eighth rank, but Carlsen prefers to start with the bishop.}) ({ANSWER: As
it's an ending assessing the activity of the pieces should be relatively easy.
We can go through them in turn. Black has four pieces left on the board 
(excluding pawns): 1) The rook on b5 is currently blocked by the white knight
and so we could argue that it is poorly placed. It is, however, potentially
putting some pressure on b2 if the knight can be shifted. --- 2) The bishop on
c7 is not really participating in the game. The white pawn chain on the dark
squares hampers the bishop so a case could have been made for} 39... Ba5 {in
order to trade it off. However, I think White would reply with} 40. Nd3 {when
the bishop doesn't really have a future on a5. --- 3) The knight on d6 is
clearly the best black piece currently. It eyes up two good squares (e4 and c4)
, whilst preventing White from thinking about breaking with c3-c4. --- 4) The
black king should also be considered, especially as it's an endgame. It is not
badly positioned, as it prevents the white rook from entering the black camp
via e7. Indeed, there is no obvious way to improve the king's position as the
white rook controls the e-file.}) 40. Kf1 Be7 41. Ke1 Bf8 {It becomes clear
that Black wants to reposition his bishop on the only open diagonal available
to it on h6.} 42. Kd1 Bh6 43. Kc2 {Before carrying out his manoeuvre Carlsen
would have needed to have foreseen whether his plan could be hindered. ---
QUESTION: So the bishop has been improved, but what next?} (43. f4 $6 {would
block the bishop, but also create a weakness at g3 and increase the
vulnerability of the e4-square (as it can no longer be defended by a pawn). I
suspect that play may have gone something like} Nf5 44. Nf1 Bf8 $1 45. Nd3 b6 {
with a later pawn break of either ...c6-c5 or ...g6-g5. White, on the other
hand, is passive and lacks an active plan of his own.}) 43... Ra5 {(ANSWER)} ({
It must have been tempting to exchange the bishop off to give the black knight
access to the holes on c4 and e4, with} 43... Bxd2 44. Kxd2 {, but it is not
so clear how to proceed after that. More importantly perhaps Carlsen wants to
keep an imbalance of bishop against knight and therefore more tension in the

{'Attack! Always Attack!' - Adolf Anderssen} 1. -- {The 'initiative' is a
slightly mysterious chess term (well, it is to me anyway), but a hugely
important and very commonly used one. When you make a move which threatens one
of your opponent's pieces, he has to parry the threat or make a counterattack.
If a number of such moves can be made in quickly, then often a serious
advantage can be built up. --- A nice comparison (well I think so anyway) can
be made with a game of tennis. The server (let's call him Pete Sampras), as
long as his serve is fast and accurate, should gain the upper hand in the
rally, as the returner (let's call him Rafael Nadal) is simply trying to put
the ball back into the court. This leads to a situation where Pete has the
initiative, as long as he makes good shots. If, for some reason, he plays a
poor or ponderous shot it will give Rafa the opportunity to seize the
initiative with a good shot of his own. If the game is on a slower surface,
such as clay, then the importance of the initiative is reduced somewhat, in
the same way that a slower paced chess game (which, say, has a closed centre)
will rely less on the initiative and more on other strategic factors. --- The
initiative is very closely linked with time or tempo in chess. It is very much
a short-term advantage and thus must be used as energetically as possible.
Witness the following awesome display by White, where he doesn't let up for a
moment.} *

Summary: Similarly to Kupreichik's game, using a series of threatening moves
White managed to prevent Black from getting his king to safety and organizing
his defences. Gradually his advantage built as his pieces became more and more

our examination of how to use the initiative to start a direct attack on the
king. Remember that it is the ability to make threats of your own, rather than
defending against them, that gives you the initiative. A lead in development,
a space advantage or a target for attack for your pieces (such as an uncastled
king) are all good indicators that a dangerous initiative might be there. If
blunders are not made in a game of chess, then the only way to win is by
attacking and only the side with the initiative can attack! Thus I would
recommend trying to seize the initiative at the earliest stage possible.} 1-0

this idea, whilst Gelfand also favoured active play and completing development

initiative is short lived, certain openings give rise to longer-term
advantages, thanks to the presence of static factors, such as superior piece
activity or a better pawn structure. A good example of this is the Benko or
Volga Gambit. The Volga Gambit was its original name (after the longest river
in Europe that runs through Russia), but due to the work of the Hungarian

{'More haste, less speed.' - The Hare and the Tortoise, Aesop's Fables --- The
concepts of prophylaxis and overprotection are very important in the world of
chess strategy. My Oxford English Dictionary defines prophylaxis as "action
taken to prevent disease". Well, that doesn't help us too much in the in the
chess world, so let's replace 'disease' with 'danger'. So, in essence
prophylaxis is any measure taken to avoid danger to us on the board before it
happens. --- We probably all use prophylactic moves in our games already, but
perhaps are not fully aware of them. My aim in this chapter is to try and make
you more aware of the importance of prophylactic play and some of the most
important ways that it can be applied to the game. Let's look at a really
basic example of prophylaxis, taken from the game of an anonymous Abbey
student.} 1... h6 {. Adam: "Did you play that to stop Bg5?" --- Student: "No,
I played it to stop bank rank mate, which always seems to happen to me!" ---
Bravo! This is prophylaxis, but at a very basic level. The stronger and more
experienced we become as chess players, the more developed our sense of danger
becomes. A better chess player will instantly be able to recognize that in the
current position, the possibility of being back rank mated is a very distant
threat (in fact it is hardly a threat at all), due to, amongst other things,
the closed nature of the position and the presence of three black pieces on
the back rank. Therefore there are more useful moves that can be made in the
position (such as the pawn break ...d6-d5 to take the centre).} *

{Be Aware, Be Very Aware: So we can say that prophylaxis is prevention of your
opponent's idea. In fact if we develop this even further we could say that it
is being aware of your opponent's idea and trying to evaluate whether you need
to take action to stop it. This involves a certain degree of anticipation as
to what the enemy's plan is going to be in a given position. Let's try a
simple exercise! --- EXERCISE: It's Black to move. Hopefully you have read the
previous chapters, particularly the one on holes! What is the best move here?

1. -- {Overprotection: Overprotection is basically just an extension of the
theme of prophylaxis. It was first encountered in Aron Nimzowitsch's classic
book 'My System'. He wrote: "Strategically important points should be
overprotected. If the pieces are so engaged, they get their regard in the fact
that they will then find themselves well posted in every respect." ---
Although we don't, of course, have to take everything that Nimzowitsch says to
be completely true, securing important squares can be regarded as an important
part of middlegame play. Successful overprotection will often persuade the
opponent to switch his focus away from such a square or piece (it can be
either), to the detriment of his position. This game by the man himself
highlights the idea.} *

evaluation can be a daunting prospect. I do my evaluations 'ceteris paribus'

{Let's take a game from the recent World Championship match between Anand and
Gelfand, which saw the Indian Grandmaster retain his title by the narrowest of
margins. --- EXERCISE: Calculate the material situation. --- ANSWER: Again
let's use the cancellation method (ignoring the kings this time): 1) White has
two rooks, as does Black - we can cancel/ignore them. --- 2) White has a
bishop and a knight, Black has two bishops. IMPORTANT: we have a material
imbalance! --- 3) White has seven pawns, Black has six. We have another
material imbalance: White is a pawn up! --- Conclusion: White is a pawn up,
but Black has two bishops versus bishop and knight. This imbalance crops up
perhaps more than any other. The points system tells us there is no great
difference between the two pieces, but the more experienced player will have
other ideas, depending on the specific position in front of him. These two
pieces move in very different ways, so the specific features of the position
will affect their values. In this particular case Black has a pair of bishops,
which is more powerful than just a single one (coupled with a knight), as they
can control both the white and black squares in unison. They both also have
good diagonals to occupy and the board is relatively open. --- We will come
back to this position later when our evaluation skills have improved further.
If you still feel as though the cancellation system is difficult, keep
practising until it becomes second nature. The material situation in any game
of chess, in any position can be evaluated in this way. Next time you are at a
tournament or watching a game at home make a conscious effort to evaluate the
material using this system before you do anything else!} 1/2-1/2

{King Safety: After the initial material evaluation is done, we must turn our
eyes towards the positional features which are prominent and it will often be
the case that something will strike you immediately. King Safety often
overrides the material situation. In fact if the king is in immediate peril
then that is normally going to be the factor that decides the game. The
following is a basic example of this.} 1. -- {White is a rook and two minor
pieces down but that doesn't matter - the material is irrelevant as he is
about to win by checkmate! --- Some may even start by trying to evaluate the
king safety before the material balance and I don't think there is a right or
wrong way round to do this. Personally I evaluate the material first because
it's more clear cut - one side will be up or down, whereas king safety can be
a little more difficult to assess.} *

is one that a lot of people get wrong. They look at the situation as a fixed
moment in time, rather than as an ongoing part of the game. It might not
always be possible to see far enough into the future to calculate a win, but
you may get a sense that the king will remain a target for some time. This is
particularly true in games with lots of pieces still on the board. We need to
put all this together before we can reach a definite conclusion on how safe
the king is. The following is a basic example, again from my students.}) *

{Question: Is the white king safe?} 4... -- {Answer: When I ask for an
assessment of the position here after four moves I often get the answer 
(before any of my training I hasten to add!), that 'the white king is more
open and weak'. I disagree with the weakness bit. We must be realistic about
our opponent's chances of attack here. In his favour are the two open
diagonals towards the king, but the closed centre, the lack of pieces
attacking the king and the number of white pieces that can protect it mean
that the white player should be perfectly fine as long as he is a little
careful along the diagonals.} *

{Development and the Initiative: It is relatively easy to evaluate the
development situation. A count of the number of pieces that are off their
starting squares and in the game will give you a good starting point for your
assessment. --- EXERCISE: After a dodgy opening Black has just gone ...f7-f5
to attack the centre. How big is White's lead in development and how should he
proceed? --- ANSWER: If we ignore the pawns for the moment a count will show
us that White has four pieces developed: two knights, one bishop and the king/
rook (I would call castling one move of development). Black has developed one
piece (the knight on c6). It is White to move so we can call this another
half-move lead in development. Thus in total White's lead in development is
three and a half. --- The Search for Chess Perfection --- International Master
and Australian chess author Cecil Purdy tragically died of a heart attack
whilst playing chess (not a good advertisement for the game I know), but his
writings are of great interest. His view was that a lead in development of two
and a half or greater is extremely dangerous. Well, here we have a three and a
half move lead and not everything else is equal - we have another factor in
our favour! The opponent's king is exposed along the weak h5-e8 diagonal! ---
My evaluation: White is probably already winning with good play.} 6. d4 $1 {

that we are still three moves up in development, with all the pieces still on

shows a lead in development of two or more should ring the warning bells in
your mind. If you have the lead look to use it to attack, whilst if you are

development lead is very much a short-term advantage and if not used quickly
is likely to evaporate.}) 1-0

1. -- {Space - The Final Frontier: Or should that be the first frontier?
Evaluating a space advantage is primarily done by looking at the pawn
structure. As discussed in Chapter Four, pawns that are further advanced give
the owner more space. The more space you own, the more options your pieces
have. Often it will be obvious as to who has the more space. A quick look
should suffice. --- If you are after a more sophisticated explanation,
Grandmaster Larry Evans, in his book 'New Ideas in Chess' picks up on the
point to look at how many squares in the opponent's half of the board you
control or occupy with your pawns and pieces. The more squares you attack, the
more space you have. A space advantage on its own isn't usually enough to win
a game. Instead it can be used as a precursor to an attack on the enemy king
(as we saw in the game Tal-Simagin in Chapter Seven), or to tie down and in
some cases immobilize the enemy pieces. Amongst grandmasters space is a
particularly valuable asset. If you study the games of one of the truly great
positional players, such as Tigran Petrosian or Anatoly Karpov, you will see a
number of examples of them slowly squeezing the life out of their opponent by
restricting their space.} *

a3, b4 (twice), c3, d4 (twice), f4 (twice) and h4. Thus White has a clear

Material is equal. --- 2) Neither king looks in any real trouble as the queens

and the activity of the pieces. --- 4) I would say that both black knights are
superior to their white counterparts. There are no access points for either
white knight due to the black pawn structure covering the important squares d5,
f5 and b5. The c3-knight could make a play for the b6-square, however. The
black knights have a brighter future due to weaknesses on the squares c4, e3,
f3 and f2. --- 5) The rook on h6 is excellently placed, targeting the weak
white h-pawn and the other black rook can back it up or occupy the open c- or
g-files. --- 6) In the endgame, as we know, the pawn structure becomes a more
telling factor. Here Black has two pawn islands to White's three. The h-pawn
is passed (and therefore must be kept an eye on), but also a target for attack.
Of bigger concern is the isolated e4-pawn, which if it falls will give Black a
huge central pawn majority. --- Conclusion: for these reasons we can assess

{Quickly Evaluating Pawn Structure in the Endgame: Pawn Islands: There are a
number of different pawn structures that you should now be able to recognize
pretty quickly when making an evaluation. Doubled pawns, isolated pawns,
passed pawns, backward pawns and hanging pawns have all been discussed in the
chapter on pawn play. The pawn structure can give dynamic characteristics to
the position. Doubled pawns allow the owner open files, isolated pawns can
control strategic strongholds, and passed pawns need no introduction as they
strive to become new queens. --- Having said that, in general the pawn
structure itself is a static feature - it will not change quickly and we can
often assess the outcome of an endgame based on this. A quick way of assessing
the general qualities of a pawn structure can be done by looking at the number
of pawn islands a player possesses. A pawn island is a group of friendly pawns
that are connected. In general, the more pawn islands you have, the weaker
your structure is.} 1. -- {In this position Black has one pawn island, whereas
White has three (h2, the e2-e3-f4 pawn mass and the queenside island).
Material is equal and the kings are equally active. Evaluation: Black has good
winning chances.} *

Who agrees with the American Grandmaster? "I do, I do", I hear you cry. It
would be against Marshall anyway, as he was known as the master of the
swindle! It certainly sometimes feels like it's the hardest part of the game
for me anyway. I suspect if there was a book out there called 'Winning Won
Positions' (a quick internet search fails to throw it up), then it would make
the author an awful lot of money. Sadly I am not qualified to write such a
book. The number of points I have squandered in my life as a result of failing
to convert winning advantages is huge. So remember when it happens that you're
not the only one, even if at times it can feel like you are. --- Before you
skip this chapter, distraught at the fact that I cannot provide the magic

this area I have picked up some useful advice I can pass on to you.} *

{Basic Winning Techniques 1: Exchanging to Win: When we are material up, one
of the most valuable techniques we have at our disposal to convert the
position is to start looking to exchange pieces into an endgame. This is good
because it normally reduces the amount of counterplay and chances your
opponent can create as he has fewer pieces left. In the diagram below Black is
a piece up. --- EXERCISE: The simplest way to convert this winning position is
to play what? --- ANSWER:} 1... Bxg2+ (1... Qxe3 $4 {would allow the
intermediate} 2. Bxd5+ Kf8 3. fxe3 {.}) 2. Kxg2 Qxe3 3. fxe3 {. Black will win
the endgame with the extra knight. This fundamental technique should become
your bread and butter, your staple diet for converting winning positions when
you are substantially up on material.} *

{'It is hard to beat a person who never gives up.' - Babe Ruth} 1. -- {Of all
the subjects in this book, the one that I am probably best qualified to write
about is defensive resourcefulness. The reason is simple - the number of
passive or worse positions I have reached in my time as a result of a lack of
opening knowledge is so numerous! I don't think anybody particularly likes
defending. As alluded to in Chapter Seven when we were talking about the
initiative, being on the attack is the way to make things happen and to be in
control of the game. Having said this, I am yet to meet a grandmaster who
cannot, if asked, defend a worse position tenaciously. It's a skill that
simply must be acquired if you are going to make progress. --- I have also met
grandmasters who use the defensive strategy to win games. Normally this arises
through taking material (normally pawns), then stubbornly defending the
position, basing their play on the 'money in the bank' that they already have.
As Bobby Fischer put it: "Concentrate on material gains. Whatever your
opponent gives you take, unless you see a good reason not to." --- One of the
big theoretical contributions that Fischer made was to the Poisoned Pawn
variation of the Sicilian Najdorf, an incredibly complex opening where Black
has to defend against a dangerous lead in development. I think the next game
is a nice introduction to the subject of successful defence.} *

1. -- {Recurring Defensive Themes in the Endgame: Having a basic understanding
of a few recurring defensive ideas in the ending should put you in reasonable
shape, in terms of what positions to head for when in difficulties. Although
every game of chess will be different, there are a few ideas which are
important to remember and understand. These are particularly relevant in the
last phase of the game when material has been reduced. This is often a time
when the player with the advantage relaxes (as they think the win is close at
hand), and allows some devious defensive resource. Stay alert at all times!} *

quite drawish in nature, due to two reasons. One is the inability of the
bishops to be exchanged and the other is the way that a bishop can stop passed
pawns in their tracks along a diagonal, sometimes even if they are in vast
numbers. This can lead to some interesting fortress positions where it is

the chapter, successful defence often requires strong nerves and the mental
fortitude not to break under pressure. This is particularly true in situations
where the 'money in the bank' strategy is used, where material is grabbed in
exchange for a certain amount of suffering. In this game the irresistible
force meets the immovable object as a young Garry Kasparov takes on 'Iron'

and a huge relief to me as I thought I was going to be crushed out of the
opening! It shows what can be done with a bit of tenacity. White survived by
managing to generate some counterplay, based on focusing on the one weakness
in the black position (the light squares around the king). Don't give up when
faced with a tough position, look to fight back and don't forget that it is
hard to beat someone who never gives up.} 1/2-1/2

{'Place the board so that the sun is in your opponent's eyes.' - Ruy Lopez de
Segura} 1. -- {Chess is known to be a mental game, a battle of the minds, but
what exactly do we mean by that? There is a lot more to the game than just
openings, tactics and endgames, as well as the strategic material that we have
discussed thus far. Sometimes chess is a war of the minds off the chess board
too. Have you ever played a game of chess where you look over your moves after
the game and don't understand why you played them? This is probably because
you are analysing your game when you are relaxed in the comfort of your own
home, rather than under the pressure that can be felt over the board. In this
chapter we will look at some of the psychological aspects of chess in
tournament play and different ways in which you can try and tackle them. I'm
sure you won't mind that this final chapter is 'wordier' than the others - it
will give you a nice break from studying chess analysis! --- People often ask
"What makes a good chess player?" The usual answers you will hear are:
intelligence, a great memory, the ability to calculate, etc. However, many
people underestimate the role of psychology in the game, which starts before a
move has even been made. Now I know I'm no sports psychologist, but I hope
some of the advice provided here that I have picked up from my experiences at
the board will be of use to you.} *

{"I'm so mean, I make medicine sick." - Muhammad Ali} 1. -- {Cast your mind
back to your first chess tournament. You are new on the chess scene, not sure
how the day is structured or of any of the tournament rules. You sit down
opposite your first round opponent, who is a lot more experienced than you are.
They are relaxed, confident and talking with their friends about previous
games, some new openings they have learnt and some trick they remember from
one of Carlsen's last games in the Bilbao Grand Slam. How do you feel? Are you
confident that you will beat your experienced opponent? Or are you now
terrified, nervous and filled with dread that they will smash you off the
board with all their tricks they supposedly know? --- If you answered 'yes' to
the second question, then you already possess a quality that is essential for
chess improvement. You are able to zone out from all of the nonsense of your
surroundings and really focus on what is important - the game of chess that
you are about to play. However, if you answered 'yes' to the third question,
then you are amongst the majority that get affected by what people say or do
to intimidate us. --- This is a common factor in many sports, whether it is
intentional or not. 'Trash talking' is recognized as the precursor to many a
big sporting battle. Muhammad Ali was one of the most prominent of trash
talkers and not only did he do this to unnerve his opponent, but also to work
himself up into a state where he really believed that he could knock his
opponent out without even breaking sweat.} (1. -- {Confidence is a huge issue
in many walks of life and chess is no different. In fact it should be even
more important in such a mental duel. Many talented chess players find that
they have reached an impasse in their chess journey to improvement, but their
tactical and positional understanding is far greater than reflected in their
rating and of their colleagues who are of a similar strength. They get
frustrated and wonder why this is. It could, of course, be for many reasons,
but quite often a big factor is confidence. This can come into effect in many
aspects of the game. There is usually at least one area of the game where
people are not confident, but it is how we deal with these perceived
weaknesses that is important. If our opponents catch a sniff of our lack of
confidence, they are sure to prey on that weakness and our results will suffer.
They will take us into some boring Berlin endgame (if they are playing me), or
set the board on fire with tactics. Quite often, it is all about appearing
confident that is the main thing. --- Who would you fancy your chances against:
someone who is looking very calm and confident, or someone who is shaking and
looking very scared and worried? Regardless of the position in front of you, I
would choose the latter. Letting your nerves get the better of you will easily
be seen in your moves. There have been many instances where talented players
get worried and lack confidence during a game, despite the fact they have been
completely outplaying their opponent. This could be due to the fact they have
a lower rating, so they assume the opponent will find some amazing,
spectacular combination to blow them off the board, even though one doesn't
exist. The first thing to remember is that we are not playing computers and
that humans make errors in judgement all the time, for all sorts of reasons,
including lack of confidence! The opposite sort of thing is seen when you play
a game against someone of the same strength, but are not aware of their rating
and play an excellent game, because that psychological barrier is not present.}
) (1. -- {Take a look at the world's top chess players - Magnus Carlsen, Levon
Aronian, Vladimir Kramnik, Vishy Anand. What do they all have in common? They
all come across as extremely confident on and off the board. Do they always
know what they are doing in their games? No, probably not, but they do not let
this be known to their opponent. It's all part of the game. --- If you are the
type of person who is negative or lacks confidence for whatever reason, then
there are some methods to try and help. Firstly, any time you do accomplish
anything, it should feel good and should help build your confidence. You
should relish these moments and imagine stepping into a spotlight of
excellence and enjoy your successes. Secondly, don't associate with those who
are negative towards you and your chess or bring you down at tournaments.
Spend time with those who are also achieving the goals that you possess or are
positive influences and use them to motivate you. Make friends off the board
with people who are of a similar standard to you and they can become possible
training partners. If you believe they are about a similar standard to you,
then you can gee each other up. Thirdly, verbal positive persuasions to
yourself will psyche you up for your big moment, just like Muhammad Ali. I try
and spend some time at the board, 10 minutes or so before the game, motivating
myself and telling myself I can win the upcoming battle. One of my friends,
Grandmaster Stephen Gordon, puts some favourite music on his iPod to get
himself 'in the zone'.}) *

{"As a chess player one has to be able to control one's feelings, one has to
be as cold as a machine." - Levon Aronian} 1. -- {Too much emotion can be bad
for anything, but especially in chess. I know that from past experience! If we
think about how the top players of the royal game are in action, we rarely see
them overreacting to any moves or situations as they are playing. They must
remain stoic, so their opponents cannot read their body language or
expressions in order to gain more insight into how they feel about their
position. This is one of the biggest difficulties in chess - you do not know
what your opponent is thinking. If you do, then you have a big advantage.
Therefore, it is important not to show too much emotion over the board, so you
do not give too much away. --- The hardest time to remain calm and emotionless
is when you have made a mistake and your opponent can immediately take
advantage of this. If you know you are someone who visibly reacts in these
situations (like me!), then get up from the board and take a walk. Do not do
it in such a way as to alarm your opponent, but take a casual stroll around
the room. The ability to maintain equanimity is a difficult one. Even after
the mistake has been made, the game may not be over, so the hard part is then
not dwelling on this mistake. Your judgement for future moves will be
seriously clouded if you keep thinking about earlier mistakes and so this is
where some verbal persuasion may come in handy again to keep you focussed and
on the right track.} (1. -- {Let's say the game was lost due to an error in
judgement and you have thrown away your chance at a big prize or a place in a
national team. What do you do? The correct answer is you should analyse your
games in the cold light of day and try to work out where you made the mistakes
and try to ensure it doesn't happen again. One of the worst things you can do
is fixate on all the negative feelings in that game, distance yourself from
everyone and let it get to you so much that it affects the rest of your
tournament. Remember that the game of chess is fun! So many times there have
been situations where one move can cause a player to lose a string of
consecutive games. However, as I have previously said, extremes are never good
and if someone does not care about their loss at all then this cannot be a
good thing as they will have no intention of improving. --- Some games are
lost before they have even started. As mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter, your game can be influenced by feelings off the chessboard. If you
were not in a good place before the game, whether you were nervous or upset,
even if you tried very hard to consciously think positively during the game,
your emotions may have caused a significant emotional imbalance to throw you
off. At the other end of the spectrum, euphoria can have a negative effect. If
you are too excited about the result of a game, then celebrating could reduce
your energy for the following games. As was discussed in Chapter Ten on
Winning Won Positions, perhaps this could even come into effect during the
middle of a crucial game (as in David-Hunt), when things are going well and
you are about to land a great result and achieve the best performance of your
life. Fixating on this prospect can cause you to lose focus and undo all the
good work done up to then. Remember a game of chess is never over until
checkmate has been obtained or the opponent has resigned or lost on time, so
we must keep playing to nullify our opponent's counterplay.}) *

{Time Management: You hear a lot of people say: "I was winning, but I lost on
time", as if this doesn't really count as a loss! The clock is an important
part of the game and if someone handled their time better than you did, then
that is fair play to them. It is generally sound advice not to get into time
trouble, but it is easier said than done. Many grandmasters regularly get
themselves into time trouble, so if they do it, what hope is there for the
rest of us? --- One of the reasons people get into time trouble comes back to
the confidence issue. If we lack confidence, then we are not going to believe
that our moves are the best and we will double, triple and quadruple check
them to make sure nothing is wrong. So going back to solving the confidence
problem should help in this department too. Another reason could be that you
are a bit of a perfectionist and that you have to find the perfect move in
every position. You may have a fear that if you don't spend a sufficient
amount of time, you will play an inferior move.} 1. -- {What most people don't
realize is that they are making a much bigger mistake by using up all of their
time and then leaving themselves with very little time at the end of the game
in a critical position. There is no point being significantly better or even
winning after 30 moves, if you cannot make the time control by move 40. Many
strong club players do not improve past this level due to these time issues.
It may surprise you but grandmasters don't sit and look for the perfect move,
they select a 'good enough' move in an average amount of time. This leaves the
pressure on their opponents to find moves to outplay them and they can waste
their own time worrying about doing this! --- There are several ways of trying
to 'cure' time-trouble. Before your game, you can estimate how much time you
expect to have used at each milestone, rationing out the time appropriately.
Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik believed that you should not use more
than 20% of your time on the first fifteen moves of the game. This is some
very good advice, but can be difficult to implement unless you are booked up
on your openings.} (1. -- {If you are the type of person who doesn't have
enough time to learn all the latest theory of trendy openings and you play
chess based on principles, this is fine. Just stick to developing moves in the
opening, rather than complicated combinations that may or may not work. Try to
play positions that you are comfortable in. If you like attacking, then make
sure you play an open game and vice-versa if you are more defensively inclined.
You are bound to slow down and take more time than necessary if you do not
feel comfortable in the position and you are unaware of the plans. --- Let's
say you have tried everything, but you still manage to find yourself in time
trouble, then what do you do? The first step is not to panic! Make sure you
don't analyse too deeply and try to play the moves that feel right in the
position, so you can conserve some more time for the really critical moves
later. Try to predict what your opponent is going to do and have a reply ready
for each move. This way you are also using your opponent's time to think.
Spend your time at the board, not wandering about looking at other games. If
you ever get a chance to look at the play of Britain's top player Michael
Adams, look at how much time he spends away from the board. The answer:
virtually none!}) *

1. -- {Practical Advice if Your Opponent is in Time-Trouble: What if it isn't
you in time-trouble? How do you handle that situation? What you should not do
is start to speed up your play in the hope that the opponent will lose on time
if you don't give them much time to think. Many times, the advantage has been
given away because both sides move too fast when one side is in time trouble.
If you have time on your clock, you should use it wisely to play accurately
and not just speed up to make your opponent panic.} *

1. -- {The Psychology of Draws: There have been many discussions about
scrapping the draw offer and these days, at the professional level, there are
'Sofia rules' in place (done for the commercial benefit - for the
entertainment of the sponsors and spectators) to prevent early 'halving out'.
This takes away somewhat from the psychological battle on the board. Tactical
draw offers are often sprung upon unsuspecting opponents. This could be just
as they have got out of a tricky position, or when they are in a slightly
better position but may not have that much time on the clock. More often than
not, when someone is offered a draw, they will spend longer than they would
normally have done over that move, pondering whether they should accept the
draw or play for the win. This is a great way to get your opponent to run down
his time in the critical stages of the game! However, if you are being offered
a draw, do not fall into this trap.} *

1. -- {Be Strong and Play for the Win!: Sometimes players use the 'illusion'
of being happy with a draw, normally through the repetition of moves. This is
often seen when the time control involves Fischer incremental timing, so they
gain some added time for each repetition. The player is often willing to
repeat the position in the hope that the opponent deviates into an inferior
line. However, there may be cases where a player has absolutely no intention
of accepting a draw, but will repeat the position twice in order to mislead
their opponent into thinking a draw is on the table, so that they let their
guard down and neglect their analysis. Then much to their disappointment, on
the third time around, some different move is made. This leads to the
opponent's emotions running wild, which then throws them off their game and
they are more likely to make a mistake. These tricks are perfectly legal in a
game of chess and it just comes with experience learning how to deal with them.
Don't be a puppet on a string! --- One of the ways to avoid disappointment in
the area of draw psychology is to tell yourself you always going to play for a
win. If you can do this, tactical draw offers will not faze you. Even if you
only require a draw for a prize or a norm, it is a great way to improve if you
always play for a win and make your opponent grovel! One of the biggest
dangers seen by many players is that they know they are quite happy with a
draw before they go in for the game and their mindset is all wrong. This
happened to me when I had the chance to make my first GM norm, when I needed a
draw with GM Jonathan Parker (see the following game).} *

always look for the best moves and go for the win, then it is more likely that
there will be pressure on your opponent and they will be more likely to make a
mistake, or you may reach a winning position and they will then be happy to
accept a draw. If your opponent knows that you only need a draw and yet you
are playing all out for a win, then this will instil even more fear into them!}

{The Psyche-out: Intimidation is a tactic used in every sport where the idea
is to mentally unbalance the opponent and put fear into them, hoping that this
will affect their performance. Since chess is a mental game, this tactic can
be used to great extent. --- Forget the usual staring into the eyes of your
opponent, strutting around the room like you own it: everyone knows those
moves. I am talking about on the board. Think back to the section where we
were working on our confidence. We know that it is a good idea to play an
opening that you are familiar with and therefore get into positions where you
are comfortable. However, if your opponent has had the chance to look up your
games and knows exactly what you are comfortable with, the chances are that
they will not allow that to happen. So the first few moves of the game can be
a psychological game of cat and mouse. This is especially the case at team
events, such as the Olympiad, or a closed tournament, where there is a lot of
time for preparation.} 1. -- {If the opponent plays something you don't expect,
then was this special preparation? Does this mean that you should change what
you play, so that you don't walk down their preparation? But that means you
might not know it as well. What should you do? With all these thoughts racing
through your head and your emotions building up, there is little room left to
concentrate on what move to actually play. --- Take a look at the beginning of
this game between two women competing in the European Team Championship (see
the following game).} *

{In order to fully understand the psychological battle between the two players,
you need to know what their usual repertoire is. White is a d4 system player -
this means she does not play any main line Queen's Gambits and sets up in the
form of a Torre Attack/London System/Colle System against everything. Black is
a King's Indian player and has always played ...g6, ...Bg7, ...d6 against
every d-pawn set-up.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 {Here White was now expecting 2...g6 as
this is what Black had played every single time before. However, the move} c5
$1 {was played. --- First of all, how do you deal with the shock? The opponent
is going to know that you didn't expect it because she had never played it
before, but you mustn't look worried. You then need to think about why your
opponent has chosen to play this move instead of something she is comfortable
with and has played all the time. If she has never played this move, then she
cannot know it that well and must have prepared something. Now, White could
play either 3 c3 or 3 e3, opting for her usual systems set-up, despite the
fact that the main line and better move is considered to be 3 d5. However, 3
d5 leads to completely different positions and some theory on Benoni-type
positions needs to be known. When calculating how to respond, think about what
they know about your game. In this game, White knew that Black expected either
3 e3 or 3 c3 and had a line prepared against this in which she would get at
least equality. Based on this, Sabrina played} 3. d5 {for the first time in
her life. --- QUESTION: Was this a stupid decision? --- ANSWER: Not at all. It
wasn't that she had no clue how to handle Benoni positions, because that would
not have been wise. It would be no good going down a line where you don't know
any plans, just to avoid prep. However, Sabrina knew that her opponent didn't
know these lines that well either so it was a good gamble. The other factor to
think about is how much time you should spend on all these moves. If you take
a long time, then it will become apparent that you were not expecting the
opening and are unsure of yourself. If you move too quickly, though, then you
may play inaccurately. --- It is the same thing if you have especially
prepared a line and your opponent is walking straight into your prep! You
should not get too excited and move straight away each time as this may
trigger an alert in their head and they may change their plans. Remain stoic
and just act as if you are still thinking about each move, but at the same
time, do not think too long. Remember Botvinnik's strategy: less than 20% of
your time for your first fifteen moves. --- After 3 d5 was played, the Israeli
player went into deep thought. This was not a good idea on her part. It left
Sabrina feeling a lot more confident that she had taken her opponent out of
prep. Even though she didn't know much about the line, clearly her opponent
didn't either! Black then played} b5 {after much deliberation. White then
chose to play} 4. c4 {, but played it rather quickly. Now, suddenly, we are in
a Benko-type position, which was not expected by either side. It is now simply
a chess match between the two players and no prep is involved. However, how
much the psyche-out affected the players is of utmost importance. --- The game
eventually ended in a draw due to both players spending too much time over the
opening moves and then having a crazy time scramble near the end which
resulted in a drawn position. However, if White had continued to play
confidently and reasonably quickly, Black would have felt a lot less
comfortable. The fact that Sabrina took so long over her opening moves gave
her opponent confidence. --- This battle for the psychological upper hand can
be seen right to the top level, where grandmasters have been out-prepped, but
they do not want to show it. You may see some of them looking up into the
distance as if they are trying to recall their preparation or a game they have
seen, but this is often a bluff! Look out for it next time you watch them play;
it's quite funny to watch.} 1/2-1/2

{1) Overall, chess is a hugely psychological game and this can often be a big
barrier for improvement. If you are actively aware of these potential hurdles,
then you can do something about them. Being able to overcome your natural
shortcomings on a temporary basis will do a lot of good for your game. This
may mean you have to invoke the verbal persuasion mentioned previously. This
is particularly important if you are interested in playing chess
professionally. If you are the type who has a nervous disposition, then it may
not be the game for you. If you depend on the money that is available for
winning chess tournaments, then the stakes are much higher and there is a lot
more pressure. Being nervous can negatively affect your play.} 1. -- {2)
General self-improvement is necessary to aid your progress. Not only do you
need to do exercises that help improve your memory or visualization at the
board, but there are physical aspects to work on also. Our top players are
normally quite healthy and in good shape and this helps to maintain their
mental concentration. Stamina is important because long chess tournaments are
extremely tiring. Little things such as getting enough rest in between games
is very important and fatigue can take a toll. In hindsight, during my year
off, I played too many tournaments, not getting the proper rest and analysis
time in between the events and as a result this hindered my progress.} (1. -- {
3) Character development and generating a positive self-image should help. You
must also be able to take criticism and learn from your mistakes. One of the
most effective ways to improve is to analyse your games. This doesn't just
mean flick through them with a computer, but to really break them down. Get a
stronger player to analyse them with you, highlighting both your strengths and
weaknesses. Cross-reference them and note any trends. If you can do this, this
will help you on the path of self-improvement. It may be painful but will
definitely help you in the future.}) (1. -- {4) However, it is not a good idea
to just focus on the weaknesses as this could bring you down. It is also
important to look at your strengths. If you are good in a certain area, then
why not practise trying to lead your games this way? This will help with the
positive thinking too as you know you are good in this area so should also
lead to increased confidence.}) (1. -- {5) Last but not least, it is a good
idea to set yourself some goals. These should not be totally unrealistic,
otherwise you will lose the drive to achieve them, but still ambitious enough
so they will motivate you. They need to be positive goals and ones which are
measurable so you can track your progress. It may be a rating gain, or a
certain amount of games played Christmas, or whatever. These goals then be
broken down into categories and checked off as they are achieved.}) (1. -- {
With all this information and hopefully a deeper insight into chess psychology,
you should obtain some new weapons to use on and off the chessboard to help
you on your path to improvement. I wish you the best of luck!}) *
